<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">A squat grey building of only thirty–four stories. Over
            the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE,
            and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.
        </p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for
            all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself,
            a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped
            lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose–flesh, but finding only the
            glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness
            responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands
            gloved with a pale corpse–coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a
            ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain
            rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak
            after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">the director: "And this,""is the Fertilizing Room."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Just to give you a general idea," he would explain to them. For of course
            some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work
            intelligently–though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy
            members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for
            virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not
            philosophers but fret–sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of
            society.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"To–morrow," he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing
            geniality, "you'll be settling down to serious work. You won't have time for
            generalities. Meanwhile…"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse's mouth into the
            notebook. The boys scribbled like mad.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"I shall begin at the beginning," said the D.H.C. and the more zealous
            students recorded his intention in their notebooks: Begin at the
                    beginning. "These," he waved his hand, "are the incubators." And opening
            an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test–tubes. "The
            week's supply of ova. Kept," he explained, "at blood heat; whereas the male
            gametes," and here he opened another door, "they have to be kept at
            thirty–five instead of thirty–seven. Full blood heat sterilizes." Rams wrapped
            in theremogene beget no lambs.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Still leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the pencils
            scurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern
            fertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduction–"the
            operation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society, not to mention the
            fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months' salary"; continued with
            some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and
            actively developing; passed on to a consideration of optimum temperature,
            salinity, viscosity; referred to the liquor in which the detached and ripened
            eggs were kept; and, leading his charges to the work tables, actually showed
            them how this liquor was drawn off from the test–tubes; how it was let out
            drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs
            which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred
            to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this
            receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free–swimming
            spermatozoa–at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic
            centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted
            out of the liquor and its contents re–examined; how, if any of the eggs
            remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again;
            how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators; where the Alphas and Betas
            remained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons were
            brought out again, after only thirty–six hours, to undergo Bokanovsky's
            Process.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">the director: "Bokanovsky's Process,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> repeated the Director, and the students underlined
            the words in their little notebooks.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">One egg, one embryo, one adult–normality. But a bokanovskified egg will
            bud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety–six buds, and every
            bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo into a
            full–sized adult. Making ninety–six human beings grow where only one grew
            before. Progress.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Essentially," the D.H.C. concluded, "bokanovskification consists of a
            series of arrests of development. We check the normal growth and,
            paradoxically enough, the egg responds by budding."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Responds by budding. The pencils were busy.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">He pointed. On a very slowly moving band a rack–full of test–tubes was
            entering a large metal box, another, rack–full was emerging. Machinery faintly
            purred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he told them. Eight
            minutes of hard X–rays being about as much as an egg can stand. A few died; of
            the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some
            eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop;
            then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four,
            eight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to
            death with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded–bud out of
            bud out of bud–were thereafter–further arrest being generally fatal–left to
            develop in peace. By which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming
            anything from eight to ninety–six embryos– a prodigious improvement, you will
            agree, on nature. Identical twins–but not in piddling twos and threes as in
            the old viviparous days, when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide;
            actually by dozens, by scores at a time.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">the director: "Scores,""Scores."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">But one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">the director: "My good boy!""Can't you see?
            Can't you see?""Bokanovsky's
            Process is one of the major instruments of social stability!"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Major instruments of social stability.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Standard men and women; in uniform batches. The whole of a small factory
            staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Ninety–six identical twins working ninety–six identical machines!" The
            voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. "You really know where you are.
            For the first time in history." He quoted the planetary motto. "Community,
            Identity, Stability." Grand words. "If we could bokanovskify indefinitely the
            whole problem would be solved."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Solved by standard Gammas, unvarying Deltas, uniform Epsilons. Millions of
            identical twins. The principle of mass production at last applied to biology.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">the director: "But, alas,""we can't bokanovskify
            indefinitely."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Ninety–six seemed to be the limit; seventy–two a good average. From the
            same ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as many batches of
            identical twins as possible–that was the best (sadly a second best) that they
            could do. And even that was difficult.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"For in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred eggs to reach
            maturity. But our business is to stabilize the population at this moment, here
            and now. Dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century–what would be the use
            of that?"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Obviously, no use at all. But Podsnap's Technique had immensely
            accelerated the process of ripening. They could make sure of at least a
            hundred and fifty mature eggs within two years. Fertilize and bokanovskify–in
            other words, multiply by seventy–two–and you get an average of nearly eleven
            thousand brothers and sisters in a hundred and fifty batches of identical
            twins, all within two years of the same age.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"And in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen
            thousand adult individuals."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">mr. foster: "Mr. Foster,""Can you

<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> They went.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">In the Bottling Room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity. Flaps
            of fresh sow's peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in
            little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub–basement. Whizz and then, click!
            the lift–hatches hew open; the bottle–liner had only to reach out a hand, take
            the flap, insert, smooth–down, and before the lined bottle had had time to
            travel out of reach along the endless band, whizz, click! another flap of
            peritoneum had shot up from the depths, ready to be slipped into yet another
            bottle, the next of that slow interminable procession on the band.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Next to the Liners stood the Matriculators. The procession advanced; one
            by one the eggs were transferred from their test–tubes to the larger
            containers; deftly the peritoneal lining was slit, the morula dropped into
            place, the saline solution poured in…and already the bottle had passed, and
            it was the turn of the labellers. Heredity, date of fertilization, membership
            of Bokanovsky Group–details were transferred from test–tube to bottle. No
            longer anonymous, but named, identified, the procession marched slowly on; on

<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum. Made them taste
            the rich blood surrogate on which it fed. Explained why it had to be
            stimulated with placentin and thyroxin. Told them of the corpus
                    luteum
            extract. Showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero
            to 2040 it was automatically injected. Spoke of those gradually increasing
            doses of pituitary administered during the final ninety–six metres of their
            course. Described the artificial maternal circulation installed in every
            bottle at Metre 112; showed them the reservoir of blood–surrogate, the
            centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it
            through the synthetic lung and waste product filter. Referred to the embryo's
            troublesome tendency to anæmia, to the massive doses of hog's stomach extract
            and foetal foal's liver with which, in consequence, it had to be supplied.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Showed them the simple mechanism by means of which, during the last two

            familiarity with movement. Hinted at the gravity of the so–called "trauma of
            decanting," and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize, by a suitable
            training of the bottled embryo, that dangerous shock. Told them of the test
            for sex carried out in the neighborhood of Metre 200. Explained the system of
            labelling–a T for the males, a circle for the females and for those who were

            choice. And of course one must always have an enormous margin of safety. So we
            allow as many as thirty per cent of the female embryos to develop normally.
            The others get a dose of male sex–hormone every twenty–four metres for the

            speeded up till it was as quick, say, as a cow's, what an enormous saving to
            the Community!</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">mr. foster: "Enormous!"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> murmured the students. Mr. Foster's enthusiasm was infectious.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">He became rather technical; spoke of the abnormal endocrine co–ordination
            which made men grow so slowly; postulated a germinal mutation to account for
            it. Could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone? Could the
            individual Epsilon embryo be made a revert, by a suitable technique, to the
            normality of dogs and cows? That was the problem. And it was all but solved.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Their wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the
            neighborhood of Metre 170 on Rack 9. From this point onwards Rack 9 was
            enclosed and the bottle performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of
            tunnel, interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">mr. foster: "Heat conditioning,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said Mr. Foster.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">mr. foster: "We
            condition them to thrive on heat,""Our colleagues

<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">the director: "And that,""that is the secret of
            happiness and virtue–liking what you've got to do. All conditioning aims at
            that: making people like their unescapable social destiny."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">In a gap between two tunnels, a nurse was delicately probing with a long
            fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle. The students
            and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in silence.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">mr. foster: "Well, Lenina,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said Mr. Foster, when at last she withdrew the syringe and
            straightened herself up.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">The girl turned with a start. One could see that, for all the lupus and
            the purple eyes, she was uncommonly pretty.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Henry!" Her smile flashed redly at him–a row of coral teeth.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">the director: "Charming, charming,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> murmured the Director and, giving her two or three
            little pats, received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">mr. foster: "What are you giving them?"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> asked Mr. Foster, making his tone very
            professional.</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Oh, the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">mr. foster: "Tropical workers start being inoculated at Metre 150,""The embryos still have gills. We immunize the fish

<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">the director: "Charming,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said the Director once more, and, with a final pat, moved away
            after the others.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">mr. foster: "To improve their sense of balance,""Doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid–air is a ticklish
            job. We slacken off the circulation when they're right way up, so that they're

            learn to associate topsy–turvydom with well–being; in fact, they're only truly

<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"They're round about Metre 900," he explained. "You can't really do any
