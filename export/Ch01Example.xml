            lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose–flesh, but finding only the
            glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness
            responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands
            gloved with a pale corpse–coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a
            ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain

            them how this liquor was drawn off from the test–tubes; how it was let out
            drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs
            which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred
            to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this
            receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free–swimming
            spermatozoa–at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic
            centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted
            out of the liquor and its contents re–examined; how, if any of the eggs
            remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again;

            purred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he told them. Eight
            minutes of hard X–rays being about as much as an egg can stand. A few died; of
            the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some
            eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop;
            then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four,
            eight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to

            anything from eight to ninety–six embryos– a prodigious improvement, you will

            centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it

            the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some
            eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop;
            then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four,

            centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it
            through the synthetic lung and waste product filter. Referred to the embryo's
