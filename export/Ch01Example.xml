            lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose–flesh, but finding only the
            glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness
            responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands
            gloved with a pale corpse–coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a
            ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain

            them how this liquor was drawn off from the test–tubes; how it was let out
            drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs
            which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred
            to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this
            receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free–swimming
            spermatozoa–at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic
            centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted
            out of the liquor and its contents re–examined; how, if any of the eggs
            remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again;

            purred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he told them. Eight
            minutes of hard X–rays being about as much as an egg can stand. A few died; of
            the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some
            eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop;
            then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four,
            eight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to

            anything from eight to ninety–six embryos– a prodigious improvement, you will

            centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it
            through the synthetic lung and waste product filter. Referred to the embryo's
