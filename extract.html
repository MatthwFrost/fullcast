<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">A squat grey building of only thirty–four stories. Over
    the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE,
    and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.
</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the
    north. Cold for
    all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself,
    a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped
    lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose–flesh, but finding only the
    glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness
    responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands
    gloved with a pale corpse–coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a
    ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain
    rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak
    after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"And this,""is the Fertilizing Room."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Just to give you a general idea,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> he would explain to them. For of course
    some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work
    intelligently–though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy
    members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for
    virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not
    philosophers but fret–sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of
    society.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"To–morrow,""you'll be settling down to serious work.
    You won't have time for
    generalities. Meanwhile…"</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"I shall begin at the beginning,""These,""are the
    incubators.""The
    week's supply of ova. Kept,""at blood heat; whereas the male
    gametes,""they have to be kept at
    thirty–five instead of thirty–seven. Full blood heat sterilizes."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Still leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the
    pencils
    scurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern
    fertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduction–</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"the
    operation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society, not to mention the
    fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months' salary"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">; continued with
    some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and
    actively developing; passed on to a consideration of optimum temperature,
    salinity, viscosity; referred to the liquor in which the detached and ripened
    eggs were kept; and, leading his charges to the work tables, actually showed
    them how this liquor was drawn off from the test–tubes; how it was let out
    drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs
    which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred
    to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this
    receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free–swimming
    spermatozoa–at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic
    centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted
    out of the liquor and its contents re–examined; how, if any of the eggs
    remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again;
    how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators; where the Alphas and Betas
    remained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons were
    brought out again, after only thirty–six hours, to undergo Bokanovsky's
    Process.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Bokanovsky's Process,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> repeated the Director, and the students underlined
    the words in their little notebooks.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Essentially,""bokanovskification consists of a
    series of arrests of development. We check the normal growth and,
    paradoxically enough, the egg responds by budding."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Scores,""Scores."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"My good boy!""Can't you see?
    Can't you see?""Bokanovsky's
    Process is one of the major instruments of social stability!"</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Ninety–six identical twins working ninety–six identical
    machines!""You really know where you are.
    For the first time in history.""Community,
    Identity, Stability.""If we could bokanovskify indefinitely the
    whole problem would be solved."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"But, alas,""we can't bokanovskify
    indefinitely."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"For in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred
    eggs to reach
    maturity. But our business is to stabilize the population at this moment, here
    and now. Dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century–what would be the use
    of that?"</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"And in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us
    over fifteen
    thousand adult individuals."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Mr. Foster,""Can you
    tell us the record for a single ovary, Mr. Foster?"</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre,""Sixteen
    thousand and twelve; in one
    hundred and eighty–nine batches of identicals. But of course they've done much
    better,""in some of the tropical Centres. Singapore has often
    produced over sixteen thousand five hundred; and Mombasa has actually touched
    the seventeen thousand mark. But then they have unfair advantages. You should
    see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary! It's quite astonishing, when
    you're used to working with European material. Still,""still, we mean to beat them if we can. I'm working on a
    wonderful Delta–Minus ovary at this moment. Only just eighteen months old.
    Over twelve thousand seven hundred children already, either decanted or in
    embryo. And still going strong. We'll beat them yet."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"That's the spirit I like!""Come along with us, and give
    these boys the benefit of your
    expert knowledge."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Mr. Foster smiled modestly. </p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"With pleasure."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> They went.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Eighty–eight cubic metres of card–index,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said Mr. Foster with relish, as
    they entered.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Containing all the relevant information,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> added the Director.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Brought up to date every morning."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"And co–ordinated every afternoon."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"On the basis of which they make their calculations."
</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"So many individuals, of such and such quality,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said Mr. Foster.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Distributed in such and such quantities."</p>

<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Unforeseen wastages promptly made good."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Promptly,""If you knew the amount of overtime I had

<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"The Predestinators send in their figures to the
    Fertilizers."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Who give them the embryos they ask for."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"And the bottles come in here to be predestined in
    detail."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"After which they are sent down to the Embryo Store."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Where we now proceed ourselves."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Embryos are like photograph film,""They can only stand
    red light."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Give them a few figures, Mr. Foster,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said the Director, who was tired of
    talking.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"But in the interval,""we've managed to do a lot to
    them. Oh, a very great deal."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"That's the spirit I like,""Let's walk
    around. You tell them everything, Mr. Foster."</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Showed them the simple mechanism by means of which, during
    the last two
    metres out of every eight, all the embryos were simultaneously shaken into
    familiarity with movement. Hinted at the gravity of the so–called </p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"trauma of
    decanting,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize, by a
    suitable
    training of the bottled embryo, that dangerous shock. Told them of the test
    for sex carried out in the neighborhood of Metre 200. Explained the system of
    labelling–a T for the males, a circle for the females and for those who were
    destined to become freemartins a question mark, black on a white ground.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"For of course,""in the vast majority of cases,
    fertility is merely a nuisance. One fertile ovary in twelve hundred–that would
    really be quite sufficient for our purposes. But we want to have a good
    choice. And of course one must always have an enormous margin of safety. So we
    allow as many as thirty per cent of the female embryos to develop normally.
    The others get a dose of male sex–hormone every twenty–four metres for the
    rest of the course. Result: they're decanted as freemartins–structurally quite
    normal (except,""that they do have the slightest tendency to
    grow beards), but sterile. Guaranteed sterile. Which brings us at last,""out of the realm of mere slavish imitation
    of nature
    into the much more interesting world of human invention."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"We also predestine and condition. We decant our babies as
    socialized
    human beings, as Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers or future…""future World controllers,""future
    Directors of Hatcheries,"</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Reducing the number of revolutions per minute,""The
    surrogate goes round slower; therefore passes through the lung at longer
    intervals; therefore gives the embryo less oxygen. Nothing like
    oxygen–shortage for keeping an embryo below par."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"But why do you want to keep the embryo below par?"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> asked an ingenuous
    student.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Ass!""Hasn't it occurred to
    you that an Epsilon embryo must have an Epsilon environment as well as an
    Epsilon heredity?"</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"The lower the caste,""the shorter the oxygen."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Who are no use at all,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> concluded Mr. Foster.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Consider the horse."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"But in Epsilons,""we don't need human
    intelligence."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Enormous!"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> murmured the students. Mr. Foster's enthusiasm was
    infectious.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Heat conditioning,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said Mr. Foster.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"We
    condition them to thrive on heat,""Our colleagues
    upstairs will teach them to love it."</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"And that,""that is the secret of
    happiness and virtue–liking what you've got to do. All conditioning aims at
    that: making people like their unescapable social destiny."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Well, Lenina,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said Mr. Foster, when at last she withdrew the syringe and
    straightened herself up.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Henry!"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> Her smile flashed redly at him–a row of coral teeth.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Charming, charming,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> murmured the Director and, giving her two or three
    little pats, received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"What are you giving them?"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> asked Mr. Foster, making his tone very
    professional.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Oh, the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness."</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Tropical workers start being inoculated at Metre
    150,""The embryos still have gills. We immunize the fish
    against the future man's diseases.""Ten to five

<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Charming,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none"> said the Director once more, and, with a final pat, moved
    away
    after the others.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"To improve their sense of balance,""Doing repairs on the
    outside of a rocket in mid–air is a ticklish
    job. We slacken off the circulation when they're right way up, so that they're
    half starved, and double the flow of surrogate when they're upside down. They
    learn to associate topsy–turvydom with well–being; in fact, they're only truly
    happy when they're standing on their heads.</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"And now,""I'd like to show you some very interesting
    conditioning for Alpha Plus Intellectuals. We have a big batch of them on Rack
    5. First Gallery level,"</p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"They're round about Metre 900,""You can't really do any

<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">Mr. Foster was disappointed. </p>
<p data-character="mr. foster" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"At least one glance at the Decanting Room,"</p>
<p data-character="narrator" data-gender="m" emotion="none">
    he pleaded.</p>
<p data-character="the director" data-gender="m" emotion="none">"Very well then.""Just one glance."</p>
